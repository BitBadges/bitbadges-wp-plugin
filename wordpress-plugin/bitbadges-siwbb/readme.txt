== Description ==

This plugin allows users to gate their site with BitBadges - claims, payments, NFT badges, and more!

Important Note: This plugin ONLY handles authentication with BitBadges - it does not restrict access to your site by itself. For restricting access, we recommend using this plugin in conjunction with:

-   [Force Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-login/) - Forces users to log in to view your site
-   [Restrict Content](https://wordpress.org/plugins/restrict-content/) - Restrict content to logged-in users
-   [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) - Advanced user roles and permissions
-   Or other plugins that restrict access to your site

   * Client ID and Secret (from your BitBadges OAuth app)
   * Redirect URI (your WordPress login callback URL)
   * State parameter (for security)

2. During Claim Verification:
